# Requirement Analysis in Software Development üìù

This Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive blueprint for a **Booking Management System**.

The purpose of this project is to simulate a real-world scenario by systematically documenting, analyzing, and structuring all necessary software requirements. This process is crucial in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for setting a clear, precise, and actionable stage for successful development and execution.


## Project Objectives

* Master the principles and methodologies of Requirement Analysis.
* Efficiently translate project needs into structured documentation.
* Identify and categorize functional and non-functional requirements.
* Leverage visual tools (like Draw.io) for system diagramming.
* Establish clear acceptance criteria for project success.


## Repository Structure (Planned)

As the project progresses, the following files and directories will be added:

* **`README.md`**: Project overview and objectives.
* **`Requirements/`**: Detailed documentation for functional and non-functional requirements.
* **`Diagrams/`**: Visual models (e.g., Use Case Diagram, Activity Diagrams).
* **`Acceptance_Criteria.md`**: Specific criteria for feature validation.
